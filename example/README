This directory contains C++ examples on using the libfoa++ library. 

Remember to run './automake.sh > Makefile.def' after adding examples 
to update the list of examples to build.

Binaries can be linked to libfoa++ both static and dynamic by uncomment the
wanted mode (LIBFOA) in the Makefile.am file.
